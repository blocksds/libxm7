# libxm7

## Introduction

A C library to play XM (and MOD) modules on Nintendo DS using only ARM7
resources (thus freeing your ARM9 from that task).

This is released as-is, under the MIT license.

- Demos of [version 0.81](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOTtW3GKVTs) and
  [version 0.93](https://vimeo.com/3364671). Thanks, Raina!

- [AngunaDS](http://www.tolberts.net/anguna/) (the *first* homebrew featuring
  libXM7)
